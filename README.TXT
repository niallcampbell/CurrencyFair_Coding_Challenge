Instructions:

Sample JSON trade messages are stored in the 'JSON_Files' folder.

The MessageFrontend class reads in each file and the MessageConsumer class converts it to a TradeMessage object. These objects are then stored in a HashMap. 

A number of methods from the MessageProcessor class then analyse these objects and prints a number of results to the console.

To run the code, run the main method in the MessageFrontend class.
